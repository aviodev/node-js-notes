## **Questions**

## 1. What is Node.js?
### Answer:
Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server, not just in the browser. Think of it like this: normally, JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive on the client side, but with Node.js, you can use the same language to handle backend tasks like managing databases, handling APIs, and building servers.

*Example for clarity:*
Imagine you're building a food delivery app. The app needs to show the menu to users, take orders, and process payments. The frontend (what users see) might use JavaScript in the browser to make the page interactive. Node.js works on the backend to fetch menu data from a database, process the orders, and send updates to the delivery person in real time—all using JavaScript.


## 2. Difference between Node.js and JavaScrip?
### Answer: 

| **Node.js**                            | **JavaScript**                           |  
|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|  
| Runs JavaScript on the server.          | Runs JavaScript in the browser.          |  
| Used for backend development.           | Used for frontend, making web pages interactive. |  
| Built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. | Executes in a browser’s JavaScript engine. |  
| Can access files, databases, and networks. | Limited to browser APIs (e.g., DOM, events). |  
| Handles server tasks like APIs and databases. | Handles client-side tasks like dropdowns and animations. |  
| Supports non-blocking, event-driven programming for scalability. | Runs in a single-threaded environment focused on the user interface. |  

**Example to understand:**  
- **Node.js:** Processes your login data on the server, checks the database, and sends back a response.  
- **JavaScript:** Validates your login form in the browser before sending it to the server.

## 3. Is Node.js single-threaded?
### Answer:   

Yes, Node.js is single-threaded, but it uses an event-driven, non-blocking model to handle multiple tasks efficiently.  

#### **Detailed Explanation**  
a. **Single-Threaded Nature:**  
   - Node.js runs all JavaScript code in a single main thread. This means only one piece of code can execute at a time.  

b. **Event Loop and Asynchronous Behavior:**  
   - Node.js uses an *event loop* to manage tasks.  
   - When tasks like reading a file or accessing a database are requested, Node.js delegates these tasks to the system's thread pool or other background workers.  
   - The main thread continues running without waiting for these tasks to finish. Once they are completed, the event loop picks up the results and processes them.  

c. **Non-Blocking I/O:**  
   - Node.js is excellent for handling tasks like serving multiple HTTP requests or handling many database queries simultaneously because it doesn’t block the main thread while waiting for results.  

#### **Example to Understand:**  
- Imagine a chef in a small kitchen (the single thread).  
- The chef takes an order (task) and asks assistants (background workers) to prepare certain ingredients (like file reading or database calls).  
- While the assistants work, the chef starts preparing the next dish. Once the assistants finish, they hand over the ingredients to the chef, who then completes the dish.  

In this way, Node.js appears to handle multiple tasks at once, even though it's single-threaded.


---

## 4. What is event-loop in Node.js?
### Answer:   

The event loop is a core part of Node.js. It handles all asynchronous operations, like reading files, making network requests, or working with timers. Since Node.js is single-threaded, the event loop ensures that tasks don't block the main thread, enabling Node.js to handle many operations simultaneously.

### **How It Works (Simple Terms):**

1. **Node.js starts your code.**
   - When you run a program, Node.js executes your code line by line.

2. **Async tasks are offloaded.**
   - Tasks like reading a file or making a network request are sent to system threads or APIs.

3. **The event loop checks for completed tasks.**
   - Once an async task finishes, the event loop checks if there's a callback or a task waiting to run.

4. **Callbacks are executed.**
   - If a task is ready, its callback is executed in the main thread.


### **Basic Example of Event Loop in Action**

```javascript
console.log('Start'); // 1. Runs first

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timer completed'); // 4. Runs after 2 seconds
}, 2000);

console.log('End'); // 2. Runs second
```

#### **What Happens Here:**
1. `console.log('Start')` runs immediately.
2. The `setTimeout` schedules a task to run after 2 seconds and hands it to the event loop.
3. `console.log('End')` runs immediately.
4. After 2 seconds, the event loop detects the timer task is ready, so it runs its callback.

### **Why Is It Useful?**
The event loop allows Node.js to:
- Handle many requests at once.
- Stay fast and efficient even with heavy workloads.
  
For example, a web server built with Node.js can serve thousands of users simultaneously without waiting for one user's request to complete before starting another.

## 5. What kind of API function is supported by Node.js?
### Answer:   
Node.js supports various types of API functions, which can be broadly categorized based on their behavior and purpose. Here's a breakdown:


#### **a. Asynchronous, Non-blocking APIs**
- These are the hallmark of Node.js.
- They allow the program to perform other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete.
- They typically use **callbacks**, **Promises**, or **async/await**.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```
- `fs.readFile` is non-blocking, so other code can run while the file is being read.


#### **b. Synchronous, Blocking APIs**
- These APIs block the execution of further code until the operation is completed.
- Useful for small tasks or initialization, but not recommended for high-performance applications.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(data);
```
- `fs.readFileSync` blocks the thread until the file is read.

 

#### **c. Streaming APIs**
- Handle data in chunks, making them ideal for working with large files or network operations.
- Streams are efficient as they don't load the entire data into memory.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const readStream = fs.createReadStream('example.txt', 'utf8');
readStream.on('data', (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk);
});
```

 

#### **d. Timer APIs**
- Used to schedule code execution after a delay or repeatedly.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
setTimeout(() => console.log('Executed after 2 seconds'), 2000);
setInterval(() => console.log('Repeats every 1 second'), 1000);
```

 

#### **e. Network APIs**
- Support creating servers and making network requests.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.write('Hello, World!');
  res.end();
}).listen(3000);
```


#### **f. File System APIs**
- Provide methods to work with files and directories.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
fs.writeFile('example.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File written successfully');
});
```


#### **g. Buffer and Binary Data APIs**
- Handle raw binary data.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const buffer = Buffer.from('Hello');
console.log(buffer.toString('utf8'));
```


#### **h. Child Process APIs**
- Allow the spawning of child processes for parallel execution.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');

exec('ls', (err, stdout, stderr) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(stdout);
});
```

#### **i. Cryptography APIs**
- Provide tools for encryption, hashing, and security.

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update('password').digest('hex');
console.log(hash);
```


#### **j. Database Interaction APIs**
- Supported via third-party modules like `mongoose` (MongoDB), `mysql`, or `pg` (PostgreSQL).

#### **Example:**
```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/test', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });
```


### **In Summary**
Node.js supports a wide range of APIs, including:
- **Asynchronous APIs** (default and recommended)
- **Synchronous APIs** (for specific use cases)
- **File, Network, Database, Stream, and Cryptographic APIs**



## 6. What is the difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous functions?
### Answer: 

### **Differences Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Functions**

| **Aspect**           | **Synchronous**                                  | **Asynchronous**                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**         | Tasks execute one after another.               | Tasks run in the background, allowing other code to execute. |
| **Blocking**          | Blocks the main thread until the task finishes. | Does not block the main thread; other code continues. |
| **Performance**       | Slower for time-consuming tasks.                | Efficient for handling tasks like I/O, network requests, etc. |
| **Use Case**          | Simple, short, or sequential tasks.             | File I/O, API calls, database queries. |
| **Error Handling**    | Errors are thrown immediately.                  | Errors are handled in callbacks, promises, or `try...catch` with `async/await`. |

---

### **Examples**

#### **Synchronous Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Blocking operation
const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
console.log(data);
console.log('This happens after the file is read.');
```
- Output (Sequential):
  ```
  File content...
  This happens after the file is read.
  ```

#### **Asynchronous Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// Non-blocking operation
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data); // Executes later
});
console.log('This happens first.');
```
- Output (Non-blocking):
  ```
  This happens first.
  File content...
  ```

## 7. What is a module in Node.js?
### Answer: 

A **module** in Node.js is a reusable piece of code, often in a separate file, that can be exported and imported into other files. It helps organize and structure your application by dividing it into smaller, manageable parts.
 

### **Key Points:**
- Node.js has **built-in modules** (e.g., `fs`, `http`) for common tasks.
- You can create **custom modules** for specific functionalities.
- Use the `require` function to import a module.


### **Example: Built-in Module**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!');
```
### **Example: Custom Module**
#### **math.js**:
```javascript
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
```
#### **app.js**:
```javascript
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(2, 3)); // Output: 5
```

## 8. What is npm and its advantages?
### Answer:

**npm (Node Package Manager)** is the default package manager for Node.js. It is a command-line tool used to manage JavaScript packages, including installing, updating, and removing libraries or tools. npm also provides an online registry (npm registry) where developers can publish and share their own packages. It simplifies project management and helps developers access a massive ecosystem of reusable code.


### **Advantages of npm:**

1. Easy dependency management.
2. Access to a large library ecosystem.
3. Simplifies development with tools for automation and testing.
4. Enables code reuse across projects.
5. Provides custom scripts to automate tasks.

## 9. What is middleware?
### Answer:

### **What is Middleware?**

In Node.js (particularly with Express.js), middleware is a function that runs between a request and a response. It processes requests, modifies responses, or performs tasks like logging, authentication, and error handling.

### **Key Features:**
1. Middleware functions have access to the `req` (request), `res` (response), and `next` objects.
2. Call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware.


### **Example: Middleware in Express.js**

Imagine you're at a **restaurant**, and here's how middleware works in simple terms:

1. **You (Client):** Place an order (HTTP Request).
2. **Waiter (Middleware):** Takes your order, writes it down, and checks if everything is correct (e.g., authentication or validation).
3. **Chef (Route Handler):** Cooks the food based on the order.
4. **Waiter (Middleware again):** Brings the food to your table (Response).


In a Node.js application:
- Middleware functions are like the **waiter**, ensuring everything (like logging, parsing data, or handling errors) happens smoothly before the request reaches the **route handler** or goes back to the client. 

### **In Short:**
Middleware acts as a "pipeline" for processing HTTP requests and responses in a web application.

Here are some real-world scenarios where middleware is commonly used:

1. **Authentication:**
   - Middleware checks if the user is logged in before granting access to protected routes.
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     if (!req.user) {
       return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
     }
     next();  // Proceed to the next middleware or route handler
   });
   ```

2. **Logging:**
   - Logs every incoming request for monitoring purposes.
   ```javascript
   app.use((req, res, next) => {
     console.log(`${req.method} request to ${req.url}`);
     next();
   });
   ```

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Catches and handles errors globally in the application.
   ```javascript
   app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
     console.error(err);
     res.status(500).send('Something went wrong');
   });
   ```

4. **Request Validation:**
   - Middleware validates the data before it reaches the route handler.
   ```javascript
   app.use('/create', (req, res, next) => {
     if (!req.body.name) {
       return res.status(400).send('Name is required');
     }
     next();
   });
   ```

5. **Rate Limiting:**
   - Prevents too many requests from the same user in a short period to avoid overload or abuse.
   ```javascript
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
   const limiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
     max: 100  // limit each IP to 100 requests per window
   });
   app.use(limiter);
   ```

These middleware functions ensure the application is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.

## 10. How does Node.js handle concurrency even after being single-threaded?
### Answer: 

Node.js is **single-threaded**, meaning it runs on just one core of the CPU. However, it can handle many operations concurrently (like serving multiple requests) without waiting for one task to complete before starting the next. This is possible because of the **Event Loop** and **non-blocking, asynchronous nature** of Node.js.


### **How It Works (Verbal Explanation)**

Think of **Node.js** as a **restaurant**:

1. **Customer (Request) Places an Order**: When a customer (client) places an order, the waiter (Node.js) doesn't just stand still waiting for the food (response) to be prepared. Instead, the waiter takes the order and **moves on to the next customer** (new request).

2. **Chef (I/O Operation)**: Meanwhile, the **chef** (database or file system) works on the food in the background. The waiter checks back with the chef to see if the food is ready (this is like checking if a file is read or a database query is completed).

3. **Serving the Food (Response)**: Once the food is ready (task completed), the waiter brings it to the correct customer. This process happens **without blocking** the waiter from taking new orders.

So, even though there’s only one waiter (single-thread), he can serve multiple customers (requests) by not waiting for the food to be cooked but delegating the cooking task to the chef (asynchronous I/O operations).


### **Real-World Example (Server Handling Multiple Requests)**

Imagine a Node.js server handling multiple requests:

1. A request for a file is received.
2. Instead of waiting for the file to be fully read (which could take a few seconds), Node.js **continues processing the next request** (for example, handling a login request).
3. Once the file is ready, the server responds with the file content.

This **non-blocking** behavior allows Node.js to handle many requests **concurrently** using a **single thread**, making it highly efficient for tasks like web servers.



### **Key Points:**
- **Single-Threaded:** Node.js runs on one thread but can manage multiple tasks at once.
- **Event Loop:** Manages the concurrency by scheduling tasks and checking if they’re done.
- **Non-Blocking I/O:** Tasks like file reading or network requests don’t block the execution of other tasks.

This combination enables Node.js to be efficient and handle many operations **simultaneously**, despite being single-threaded.
